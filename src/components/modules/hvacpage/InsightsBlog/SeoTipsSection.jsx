            puts it: "Conversational search has a big message, and that is that
            SEO is no longer a commodity. For HVAC, it's very important to
            understand that your customers are looking for solutions to
            problems, not just services. They want to know that you understand
            their specific needs."

              1. Create Content That Speaks Like Your Customers
            </h3>
            <p className="text-gray-600 mb-4 leading-relaxed">
              Your customers aren't using marketing keywords. They're asking
              full questions, describing symptoms, and explaining what they need
              in their own words.

                "People aren't going to Google like a search engine anymore,

                "Instead of searching for 'air conditioner' or 'furnace,'
                they'll search 'repair.' The questions they ask are: 'Why is my
                air conditioner making noise?' or 'How do I know if my furnace
                is broken?'"
